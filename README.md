# cpp-exercises
Academic C++ exercises

These programs are all inspired by exercises in “C++: How to Program (10th Edition)” by Deitel & Deitel.

They were completed in my Object Oriented Programming graduate class at Syracuse University, taught by Mr. Jonathan Weissman January - March 2021

Each exercise required a 3 file hierarchy: an interface file (.hpp), the implementation file (.cpp), and the testing file (.cpp with main() function)
